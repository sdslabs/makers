# Automatic Brightness Controller

Automatic Brightness Controller is a simple python script which adjusts the brightness of your screen according to the colours rendered on your screen to
reduce eye strain throughout your current session.

Below is the link to my repository for the project. All the info, setup instructions using guidelines to use to program are provided in the project readme 
file itself. I would be very happy to receive feedbacks to improve the program.
